A transparent proxy that allows a Claude Max subscription to be used with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), preserving multi-model agent routing.

OpenCode targets the Anthropic API, while Claude Max provides access to Claude via the [Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk). The proxy forwards tool calls from Claude Max to OpenCode so agent routing works correctly.

Tool execution is handled within the Agent SDK, which is responsible for running tools, coordinating sub-agents, and streaming responses. Because the SDK only has access to Claude models, any tool calls or delegated tasks are executed within that scope. In configurations such as [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode), where agents may be assigned to OpenaI, Gemini, or other providers, those assignments are not preserved at execution time, and all work is effectively routed through Claude.

We avoid that limitation by forwarding tool calls instead of executing them. When a `tool_use` event is emitted, the proxy intercepts it, halts the current turn, and sends the raw payload back to OpenCode. OpenCode executes the tool, including any agent routing, and returns the result as a `tool_result`. The proxy then resumes the SDK session.

From Claude’s perspective, tool usage proceeds normally. From OpenCode’s perspective, it is interacting with the Anthropic API. Execution remains distributed according to the configured agents, allowing different models to handle different roles without being constrained by the SDK.

## How Passthrough Works

The Claude Agent SDK exposes a `PreToolUse` hook that fires before any tool executes. Combined with `maxTurns: 1`, it gives us precise control over the execution boundary without monkey-patching or stream rewriting.

1. **Claude generates a response** with `tool_use` blocks (Read a file, delegate to an agent, run a command)
2. **The PreToolUse hook fires** for each tool call - we capture the tool name, input, and ID, then return `decision: "block"` to prevent SDK-internal execution
3. **The SDK stops** (blocked tool + maxTurns:1 = turn complete) and we have the full tool_use payload
4. **The proxy returns it to OpenCode** as a standard Anthropic API response with `stop_reason: "tool_use"`
5. **OpenCode handles everything** — file reads, shell commands, and crucially, `Task` delegation through its own agent system with full model routing
6. **OpenCode sends `tool_result` back**, the proxy resumes the SDK session, and Claude continues

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Claude Max subscription** — [Subscribe here](https://claude.ai/settings/billing)
2. **Claude CLI** authenticated: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code && claude login`

### Option A: npm Install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-claude-max-proxy

# Start in passthrough mode (recommended)
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 claude-max-proxy
```

### Option B: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rynfar/opencode-claude-max-proxy
cd opencode-claude-max-proxy
bun install

# Start in passthrough mode (recommended)
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 bun run proxy
```

> **Note:** Running from source requires [Bun](https://bun.sh): `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

### Option C: Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rynfar/opencode-claude-max-proxy
cd opencode-claude-max-proxy

# Start the container
docker compose up -d

# Login to Claude inside the container (one-time)
docker compose exec proxy claude login

# Verify
curl http://127.0.0.1:3456/health
```

> **Note:** On macOS, `claude login` must be run inside the container (keychain credentials can't be mounted). On Linux, volume-mounting `~/.claude` may work without re-login.

### Connect OpenCode

#### Environment Variables

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 opencode
```

The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` can be any non-empty string — the proxy doesn't use it. Authentication is handled by your `claude login` session.

#### Shell Alias

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc or ~/.config/fish/config.fish
alias oc='ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 opencode'
```

#### OpenCode Config File

Alternatively, the proxy URL and API key can be set globally in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. This has the benefit of working in OpenCode Desktop as well.

```json
{
  ...
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:3456",
        "apiKey": "dummy"
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

## Modes

### Passthrough Mode (recommended)

```bash
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 bun run proxy
```

All tool execution is forwarded to OpenCode. This enables:

- **Multi-model agent delegation** — oh-my-opencode routes each agent to its configured model
- **Full agent system prompts** — not abbreviated descriptions, the real prompts
- **OpenCode manages everything** — tools, agents, permissions, lifecycle

### Internal Mode (default)

```bash
bun run proxy
```

Tools execute inside the proxy via MCP. Subagents run on Claude via the SDK's native agent system. Simpler setup, but all agents use Claude regardless of oh-my-opencode config.

|                       | Passthrough            | Internal            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Tool execution        | OpenCode               | Proxy (MCP)         |
| Agent delegation      | OpenCode → multi-model | SDK → Claude only   |
| oh-my-opencode models | ✅ Respected           | ❌ All Claude       |
| Agent system prompts  | ✅ Full                | ⚠️ Description only |
| Setup complexity      | Same                   | Same                |

## Works With Any Agent Framework

The proxy extracts agent definitions from the `Task` tool description that OpenCode sends in each request. This means it works automatically with:

- **Native OpenCode** — `build` and `plan` agents
- **oh-my-opencode** — `oracle`, `explore`, `librarian`, `sisyphus-junior`, `metis`, `momus`, etc.
- **Custom agents** — anything you define in `opencode.json`

In internal mode, a `PreToolUse` hook fuzzy-matches agent names as a safety net (e.g., `general-purpose` → `general`, `Explore` → `explore`, `code-reviewer` → `oracle`). In passthrough mode, OpenCode handles agent names directly.

## Session Resume

The proxy tracks SDK session IDs and resumes conversations on follow-up requests to enable faster responses and better context. Session tracking works two ways:

1. **Header-based** (recommended) — Add the included OpenCode plugin:

   ```json
   {
     "plugin": [
       "./path/to/opencode-claude-max-proxy/src/plugin/claude-max-headers.ts"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Fingerprint-based** (automatic fallback) — hashes the first user message to identify returning conversations

Sessions are cached for 24 hours.

## Configuration

| Variable                            | Default   | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH`          | (unset)   | Enable passthrough mode to forward all tools to OpenCode |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT`                 | 3456      | Proxy server port                                        |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_HOST`                 | 127.0.0.1 | Proxy server host                                        |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_WORKDIR`              | (cwd)     | Working directory for Claude and tools                   |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_MAX_CONCURRENT`       | 1         | Max concurrent SDK sessions (increase with caution)      |
| `CLAUDE_PROXY_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 120       | Connection idle timeout                                  |

## Concurrency

The proxy supports multiple simultaneous OpenCode instances. Each instance spawns its own independent SDK subprocess and all concurrent responses are delivered correctly.

**Use the auto-restart supervisor** (recommended):

```bash
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 bun run proxy
# or directly:
CLAUDE_PROXY_PASSTHROUGH=1 ./bin/claude-proxy-supervisor.sh
```

> **⚠️ Known Issue: Bun SSE Crash ([oven-sh/bun#17947](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/17947))**
>
> The Claude Agent SDK's `cli.js` subprocess is compiled with Bun, which has a known segfault in `structuredCloneForStream` during cleanup of concurrent streaming responses. This affects all runtimes (Bun, Node.js via tsx) because the crash originates in the SDK's child process, not in the proxy itself.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - **Sequential requests (1 terminal):** No impact. Never crashes.
> - **Concurrent requests (2+ terminals):** All responses are delivered correctly. The crash occurs _after_ responses complete, during stream cleanup. No work is lost.
> - **After a crash:** The supervisor restarts the proxy in ~1-3 seconds. If a new request arrives during this window, OpenCode shows "Unable to connect" — just retry.
>
> We are monitoring the upstream Bun issue for a fix. Once patched, the supervisor becomes optional.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why passthrough mode instead of handling tools internally?</strong></summary>

If the Agent SDK executes tools directly, everything runs through Claude. Any agent routing defined in OpenCode is bypassed. Passthrough mode just sends the tool calls to OpenCode to run.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work without oh-my-opencode?</strong></summary>

Yes. Both modes work with native OpenCode (build + plan agents) and with any custom agents defined in your `opencode.json`. oh-my-opencode just adds more agents and model routing. The proxy handles whatever OpenCode sends.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do I need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy`?</strong></summary>

OpenCode requires an API key to be set, but the proxy never uses it. Authentication is handled by your `claude login` session through the Agent SDK.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about rate limits?</strong></summary>

Your Claude Max subscription has its own usage limits. The proxy doesn't add any additional limits. Concurrent requests are supported.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data sent anywhere else?</strong></summary>

No. The proxy runs locally. Requests go directly to Claude through the official SDK. In passthrough mode, tool execution happens in OpenCode on your machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does internal mode use MCP tools?</strong></summary>

The Claude Agent SDK uses different parameter names for tools than OpenCode (e.g., `file_path` vs `filePath`). Internal mode provides its own MCP tools with SDK-compatible parameter names. Passthrough mode doesn't need this since OpenCode handles tool execution directly.

</details>
